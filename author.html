            <p>J. K. Rowling, born in 1965, British author, who writes about the magical adventures of a boy wizard named Harry Potter.   </p>

            <p> The Harry Potter book series dominated bestseller lists beginning in the late 1990s, attracting millions of fans worldwide among children and adults alike.    </p>

            <p>Like that of her own character, Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling's life has the luster of a fairy tale. Divorced, living on public assistance in a tiny Edinburgh flat with her infant daughter, Rowling wrote Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at a table in a cafe during her daughter's naps — and it was Harry Potter that rescued her.
Joanne Kathleen Rowling entered the world in Chipping Sodbury General Hospital in Bristol, England, a fitting beginning for someone who would later enjoy making up strange names for people, places and games played on flying broomsticks. Her younger sister Di was born just under two years later. </p>





            <blockquote class="blockquote">Rowling remembers that she always wanted to write and that the first story she actually wrote down, when she was five or six, was a story about a rabbit called Rabbit. Many of her favorite memories center around reading—hearing The Wind in the Willows read aloud by her father when she had the measles, enjoying the fantastic adventure stories of E. Nesbit, reveling in the magical world of C. S. Lewis's Narnia, and her favorite story of all, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge.  </blockquote>

            <p>train ride from

Manchester to London in the summer of

1990, the idea came to her of a boy who is

a wizard and doesn't know it. He attends a

school for wizardry--she could see him

very plainly in her mind. By the time the

train pulled into King's Cross Station

four hours later, many of the characters

and the early stages of the plot were

fully formed in her head. The story took

further shape as she continued working on

it in pubs and cafes over her lunch hours.
In 1992 Rowling left off working in

offices and moved to Portugal to teach

English as a Second Language. In spite of

her students making jokes about her name

(this time they called her "Rolling

Stone"), she enjoyed teaching. She worked

afternoons and evenings, leaving mornings

free for writing. After her marriage to a

Portuguese TV journalist ended in divorce,

Rowling returned to Britain with her

infant daughter and a suitcase full of

Harry Potter notes and chapters. She

settled in Edinburgh to be near her sister

and set out to finish the book before

looking for a teaching job. Wheeling her

daughter's carriage around the city to

escape their tiny, cold apartment, she

would duck into coffee shops to write when

the baby fell asleep.</p>
  <blockquote class="blockquote"> In this way she

finished the book and started sending it

to publishers. It was rejected several

times before she found an London agent,

chosen because she liked his name--

Christopher Little, who sold the

manuscript to Bloomsbury Children's Books.
Rowling was working as a French teacher

when she heard that her book about the boy

wizard had been accepted for publication.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

was published in June 1997 and achieved

almost instant success. With the

publication of the American edition,

retitled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's

Stone, in 1998, Rowling's books continued

to make publishing history. Harry Potter

climbed to the top of all the bestseller

lists for children's and adult books. </blockquote>
